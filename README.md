Hohpe, G., & Woolf, B. (2004). Chapter 9 - Interlude: Composed Messaging. In _Enterprise integration patterns: Designing, building and deploying messaging solutions_ (pp. 401â€“444). Addison-Wesley. 

Ideas I'm exploring:

- Asynchronous communication using messages, queues 
- NServiceBus - https://docs.particular.net/
- C4 Model Diagrams - https://c4model.com/

Other topics to explore:
- Persisting business data to DB
- Using Outbox to create transaction around DB save + message send
- Deployment to cloud service
